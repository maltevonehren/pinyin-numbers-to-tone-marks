# pin1yin1 → pīnyīn

An anki add-on that changes pinyin with numbers to pinyin with tone marks

## Usage

By default the add-on will be applied on all fields that are called `pinyin`
(case-insensitive).

For example `xian4zai4` will become `xiànzài`.
Apostrophes are also inserted where necessary,
so `wan3an1` will become `wǎn'ān`.

### Change all notes in a deck

### While editing a single note

To see the changes, click out of the field.
